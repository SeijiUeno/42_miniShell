Performance

Insertion:
Linked List: O(1) time complexity (insertion at the head).
Search and Deletion:
Linked List: O(n) time complexity.

Conclusion:

For small to medium-sized applications (like the mini-shell)
the O(n) search time of the linked list is acceptable.

Memory Overhead
Linked List:
Each node contains two pointers (address and next).
Minimal memory overhead.

Linked List Approach:

Aligns with the project's needs.
Simplicity makes it easier to integrate and maintain.
Performance is adequate for the expected workload.

Pros:
Simple and effective for small applications.
Low memory overhead.
Easier to implement and maintain.
Cons:
Less efficient for a large number of allocations.

Check for Errors:
Allocation Errors

Always check if gc_allocate returns NULL.
Handle allocation failures gracefully, possibly by freeing other resources and exiting.
Deallocation Errors:

Check the return value of gc_deallocate.
If deallocation fails, investigate whether the pointer was already deallocated or was not allocated using gc_allocate.
Use After Free:

Avoid using pointers after they have been deallocated.
Set pointers to NULL after deallocation to prevent accidental use.
Preventing Undefined Behavior:
Do Not Double Free:

Do not call gc_deallocate multiple times on the same address.
After deallocation, set the pointer to NULL.
Do Not Mix free and gc_deallocate:

Mixing standard free with gc_allocate can lead to undefined behavior.
Always use gc_deallocate for memory allocated with gc_allocate.
Thread Safety:

The current implementation is not thread-safe.
If using threads, ensure that access to the garbage collector is properly synchronized.
